# Arizard's Improved TTT Sweps

I was getting fed up with the default TTT sweps, 
and I was also getting annoyed at people who installed M9K onto their TTT servers, so
I created this addon as a replacement for the default TTT weapons so that people didn't have to be stuck with either end
of the spectrum.

# Features

## Main Differences

* All weapons have recoil
* Added AK-47
* M-16 fires faster
* Pistol fires slower
* Deagle fires slower
* Shotgun reloads slower
* Shotgun deploys slower
* Rifle is more accurate (less spread)
* Glock is more accurate

## Grenades
Grenades will bounce predictably and consistently - they have a spherical hitbox now. This allows players to better understand where their grenade is going to land. 
Grenades are also bouncier and make noise when they hit a surface at high speed.

Working flash grenades have been added to the T and D menu and make a bouncing noise when they hit a surface. They do not deafen, they only blind for maybe 10 seconds or so.

## Recoil

Weapons in this addon recoil in a predictable and compensatable manner. Weapon spread is random, however recoil always
kicks upwards and slightly to the right.

Recoil does not change your eyeangles at all - if you stop shooting, your eye angles return back to normal.
Recoil is predicted clientside, but calculated serverside. Both these features prevent aimbotters holding mouse1
and slaughtering the server.

## ADS

Aiming down sights has a snappier and more pleasant feel to it. Moving while aiming down sights makes it more difficult
to aim, thus balancing the "run-and-gun" aspect of TTT.

Ironsights are also consistently accurate and always correspond to where your first bullet would land if 
there were no spread.

## Movement

Guns are now slightly less accurate when moving, to avoid ADADAD players and run-and-gunners. Run-and-gun is still a
viable option with the Glock, MAC-10, Shotgun and Pistol, but weapons such as the Rifle, Deagle, M-16, Ak-47, HUGE-249 are non-viable
as run-and-gun weapons.

## Headshot buffs

Headshots do *even more damage* now, to reward players who take the time to become proficient at using these weapons.

# Weapons in Detail

* AK-47
  * Medium-high damage
  * Medium-high fire rate
  * Medium-high recoil
  * 30-bullet magazine, max 60 reserve
  * Low spread
  * Bad running accuracy
  * Basically an all-round, accurate yet powerful automatic rifle which kicks like a mule. Capable of killing a player with a single headshot.
  
* M-16
  * Medium damage
  * Medium fire rate
  * Low-medium recoil
  * 20-bullet magazine, max 60 reserve
  * Low spread
  * Bad running accuracy
  * A precision assault rifle with lower recoil than it's counterpart, the AK-47, but also slightly less damage.
  
* Glock (Secondary)
  * Low damage
  * High fire rate
  * Low recoil
  * 20-bullet magazine, max 60 reserve
  * Medium spread
  * Good running accuracy
  * A fully-automatic pistol capable of filling opponents with bullets at close range. Less effective at mid-long range.
  
* MAC-10
  * Low damage
  * High fire rate
  * Low-medium recoil
  * 30-bullet magazine, max 60 reserve
  * Medium spread
  * Good running accuracy
  * A weak but fast SMG. More effective in CQB where players can make best use of it's high mobility.
  
* Pistol (Secondary)
  * Medium damage
  * Low-medium fire rate
  * Low recoil
  * 20-bullet magazine, max 60 reserve
  * Low-medium spread
  * Good running accuracy
  * More powerful than the glock but with a much much slower firing rate. Semi-automatic, so you better have some fast fingers.
  
* Deagle (Secondary)
  * High damage
  * Low fire rate
  * High recoil
  * 8 bullet magazine, max 36 reserve
  * Low spread
  * Bad running accuracy
  * Literally a hand-cannon. High damage output but low clip size. Terrible running accuracy. Good if you can land headshots.
  
* Rifle
  * Super High damage
  * Lowest fire rate (bolt-action)
  * Medium-High recoil
  * 10 bullet magazine, max 20 reserve
  * Lowest spread (even when unscoped)
  * Bad running accuracy
  * Super effective at long range due to it's high damage and scope. Bad at close range and while moving. Kills with 1 headshot.

* Shotgun
  * Super Super High damage total, but low damage per pellet (8 pellets per shot)
  * Medium-low fire rate
  * Medium-high recoil
  * 8 bullet magazine, max 24 reserve
  * High spread (it's a shotgun, duh, but pellets are always shot outwards from the crosshair)
  * Alright running accuracy
  * Super effective at close range due to it's high damage output, but terrible at long range due to it's high pellet spread. Running makes the pellets spread further apart.
  
* HUGE 249
  * Low damage
  * High fire rate
  * High recoil
  * 150 bullet magazine, max 0 reserve
  * High spread
  * Bad running accuracy
  * You pretty much don't want to use this unless you're spraying into a crowd of Innocents as a distraction so that 
  your teammate can do something useful during the confusion. God help you.


# Impact on TTT Meta

I hope that these features will create a somewhat different meta to the default TTT. 

Rifle + Deagle has a lesser advantage,
due to both having low mobility stats - players might choose a mobile and a non-mobile weapon as their primary
and secondary. Rifle + Pistol combos could find create a balance between mobility and damage.

Shotgun + Deagle may have high damage output, but the Shotgun's slow reload speed and the Deagle's lack of mobility may
leave the user vulnerable.

M-16 has an advantage at long range due to it's high accuracy and fire rate, but accuracy receives a major nerf while
moving. M-16 + Glock addresses these issues - the Glock can be used as a high-power mobile CQB weapon, while the M-16 
is used for picking off targets at range.
